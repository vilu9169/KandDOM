Derive the open-loop system from the reference signal R(s) and disturbance
D(s) to output Y(s).
(1 p)
b) Show that the open-loop system is stable and that when there is no distur-
bance, d(t) = 0, then the control error is zero.
c) Next, we consider using a feedback controller
U(s) = K(R(s) – Y(s))
and determine K such that the closed-loop system is stable.

d) Mention two advantages of using the feedback controller in c) over the
controller in a).

{pageend nr 7}{pagestart nr 8}Proposed solution to problem 2
a) To derive the transfer function between R(s) and D(s) and the output Y(s)
we note that
Y(s) = D(s) + G(s)U(s) = D(s) + G(s)F(s)U(s).
b) The open loop stability depends on whether G(s)F(s) contains unstable
poles:
G(s)F(s):

Note that this transfer function is input-output stable but not asymptotically
stable. Indeed, the cancellation of the pole s = 0 — which is not strictly
stable (it is just marginally stable) with the corresponding zero produces a
non-reachable/non-observable part with unstable dynamics. When there is no
disturbance Y(s) = 1R(s), so the steady-state error is null.
c) The proportional controller F(s) = K yields the following closed-loop trans-
fer function

We pick, for example, K = 5.
b) See the slides.
c) The transfer function between the measurement noise N(s) and the output
Y(s) is the complementary sensitivity function. In this case, at low frequencies
|Go(iw)|≈ 0, so |T(iw)|≈ 0. This means that low-frequency noise is attenuated,
but it also means that the static error is big (because of the derivative action).
|K|
At high frequencies, |G。(iw)|≈ |K|, and hence |T(iw)|≈
The noise gets
