# Pythia – AI-Powered Legal Document Management

Pythia is a web application designed to enhance document management for legal entities.  
Navigating through legal documents traditionally involves manual processes such as keyword searches or skimming through pages of text, which are time-consuming and prone to human error.  

Pythia addresses this by providing an **AI-powered tool** tailored specifically for extracting and analyzing information from **large Swedish legal documents**.
